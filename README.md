Summer Breeze - Sample Android Weather App
============

### Key Features 
* Uses OpenWeatherMap APIs to display current weather, forecasts & historical weather
* Google maps with a weather layer is used to show weather on a map.

### Known Issues
* As a sample app, not all edge cases are covered (might crash on certain edge cases)
* Historical data is limited due to API restrictions
* Getting closest station API from OpenWeatherMap is somewhat unstable and therefore, a default station has been set for display purposes.
* Using the Google maps weather layer could be improved and instead of Google data, the OpenWeatherMap could be utilized for a more consistent UX.
* Developed on a Nexus 7 (2013) running Lollipop (not optimized for smartphones).
